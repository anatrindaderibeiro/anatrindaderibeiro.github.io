I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the National Student Support Accelerator at Stanford University. My work leverages NLP and other ML methods to analyze video, audio, and text data to understand student engagement and effective tutor practices in virtual instruction sessions. I completed my Ph.D. in Economics and Education in 2023, with research using experimental and other causal inference methods to evaluate programs and investigate behavior differences across demographic groups. I am also passionate about finding efficient technology and data uses to improve and facilitate team collaboration and generate insights to inform decisions.
